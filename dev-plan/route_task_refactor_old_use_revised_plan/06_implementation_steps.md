# VI. Implementation Steps

1.  **Implement the `cancel_job` endpoint.**
2.  **Modify the `route_task` tool to integrate with Retriv, the decision engine, and VS Code for user input, cost estimation, and task cancellation.**
3.  **Enhance the decision engine to support task breakdown, multi-model routing, job tracking, and token/cost optimization.**
4.  **Implement the VS Code integration features.**
5.  **Test the refactored tools with Claude to ensure compatibility and performance.**
