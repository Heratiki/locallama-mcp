description: "Detailed development plan for the LocalLama Model Context Protocol server implementation"

principles:
  - "Token efficiency first - optimize all operations for minimal token usage"
  - "Safety by default - all operations are read-only unless explicitly required"
  - "Progressive enhancement - start with basic functionality, enhance iteratively"
  - "Modular architecture - keep components loosely coupled for easy updates"
