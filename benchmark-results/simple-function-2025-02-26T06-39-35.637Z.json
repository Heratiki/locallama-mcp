    "output": "Here is a simple JavaScript function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion:\n\n```javascript\nfunction factorial(n) {\n    if (n === 0 || n === 1)\n        return 1;\n    else\n        return n * factorial(n - 1);\n}\n```\n\nYou can call this function with an integer argument to get its factorial. For example, `factorial(5)` would return `120`.\n\nThis function uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number. It keeps calling itself with smaller and smaller values until it reaches the base case where `n` is 0 or 1. At this point, the function returns 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is defined as 1.\n\nIn the general case, the function multiplies the current value of `n` by the factorial of `n - 1`. This continues until the base case is reached."
