Plan for Integrating OpenRouter Free Models:

Configuration:
Configure the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable with the provided API key.
Review and adjust other relevant settings in src/config/index.ts, such as decision thresholds or benchmark configuration, as needed.
OpenRouter Module Updates (src/modules/openrouter/index.ts):
Model Tracking:
Update the modelTracking object to include free models from OpenRouter.
Ensure the freeModels array is populated with the IDs of available free models.
Prompting Strategies:
Develop and integrate prompting strategies for free models, considering their capabilities and limitations.
Update the getDefaultPromptingStrategy function to handle free models.
API Calls:
Modify the callOpenRouterApi function to support free models, handling any specific requirements or constraints.
Decision Engine Updates (src/modules/decision-engine/index.ts):
Free Model Integration:
Update the routeTask function to consider free models from OpenRouter in the decision-making process.
Integrate free models into the getBestFreeModel function, ensuring it returns the most suitable free model based on task characteristics.
Cost Estimation:
Update the costMonitor.estimateCost function to account for the cost of using free models (i.e., zero cost).
Benchmarking:
Consider including free models in benchmarking tasks to evaluate their performance and update model performance profiles accordingly.
Testing and Validation:
Unit Tests:
Create unit tests for the updated openRouterModule and decisionEngine to ensure they handle free models correctly.
Integration Tests:
Develop integration tests to verify the end-to-end functionality of free model integration, including routing decisions and API calls.
Manual Testing:
Perform manual testing to validate the overall user experience and correctness of free model integration.
Next Steps:

Once the user provides the OPENROUTER_API_KEY, proceed with the updates outlined in the plan.
After completing the updates, perform thorough testing to ensure the integration is correct and functional.
